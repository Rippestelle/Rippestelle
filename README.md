- 👋 Hi there, I'm Estelle ! </br>
     Come in, make yourself at home. 
     
- 👀 I’m currently looking for a full-remote job or new clients as I'm trying the freelance adventure for the 2022 year.
- 🧠 Thanks to five months of intensive training (from January 2021 to June 2021), I've learned how to use HTML5, CSS3, PHP7, MySQL, JS, Sass, WordPress and Vue.js.
- 🎓 Last September I got my professional title in web development.
- 👶 In August and September, I did an internship with two freelancers on this project: https://www.prime-copy.com/ . It's an application to generate content thanks to an Artificial Intelligence (with Open AI API). 
- 👩‍💻 For now I don't have much work to show on Github but wait for it, I'm working on several projects ! I'm currently working on WordPress projects and on my Portfolio. I'm also learning how to use TypeScript and Angular (with Ionic) on a literary project within a team.
- 📗 And before? Before this new life, I was studying literature and languages in order to become a Librarian. But as I get easily bored, I've jumped in the Web Development world to keep learning and stay "student" for life! I am fascinated by the constant change in the IT world and I stay open to new technologies.
